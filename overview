# GiftTracker—Gift Smart

Ever bought a gift for someone, given it to them—and realized as they're opening it that you've already given them that gift?! So embarrassing—and so preventable.

If you've got a lot of friends and family to buy gifts for, you've definitely seen this more than once. But who has the time to keep track of everything? Excel files, paper lists—none of it's convenient.

Now there's GiftTrackr, an easy-to-install API that lets users keep track of gift history, and avoid repeating gifts. GiftTrackr's API can be integrated with calendar apps, shopping list apps, address books, and more.

With GiftTrackr, you can do the following:

- Retrieve gifts purchased by recipient name

- Retrieve gift by title

- Get recipients by birth month
